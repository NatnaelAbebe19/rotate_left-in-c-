# Array Left Rotation in C++

This repository contains a **C++ program** designed to rotate an array to the left by a specified number of positions. Array rotation is a common operation used in various programming challenges and real-world applications, such as data manipulation, circular queues, and cyclic operations.

## Features
- Rotates an array to the left by a given number of positions.
- Accepts dynamic input for the array size and elements.
- Handles edge cases, such as rotation by 0 or rotation greater than the array size.
- Efficiently rotates the array using minimal extra space.

## How It Works
1. The program reads the size of the array and the array elements from the user.
2. It then asks for the number of positions by which the array should be rotated.
3. Using efficient algorithms, the program rearranges the elements to simulate a left rotation.

For example:
- Input: Array = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, Rotate by = `2`
- Output: Array = `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Compile the C++ code using any C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o array_rotation array_rotation.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./array_rotation
   ```

## Input and Output
### Input:
- First, enter the size of the array.
- Next, input the elements of the array.
- Finally, input the number of positions for the left rotation.

### Output:
- The program prints the array after performing the left rotation.

### Example:
#### Input:
```
Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter the number of positions to rotate: 2
```

#### Output:
```
Array after left rotation: 3 4 5 1 2
```

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- Basic understanding of arrays and input/output operations in C++.
